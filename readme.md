I'll save my work by tasks of videolessons by seperating them on different branches

The way I'll learn `go` it's:
1. Try to solve the task without the solution video | done
2. If solved, then fix the bad solutions by watching the learning video | done
3. If not solved, still wathcing the video and then try to solve the problem by myself.

The requirements of this exercise:
1. It's quize game.
2. Build a little application that will read the csv file and start a quize that have a timer. The quize will be a relatively simple.
3. The flags of the program is:
   1. -csv string
      1. a csv file in the format of 'questions,answer' (default "problem.csv")
   2. -limit int
      1. the time limit for the quizz in seconds (default 30)
