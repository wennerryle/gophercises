## my empty repo of [gophercises](https://gophercises.com/)

I'll save my work by tasks of videolessons by seperating them on different branches

The way I'll learn `go` it's:
1. Try to solve the task without the solution video
2. If solved, then fix the bad solutions by watching the learning video
3. If not solved, still wathcing the video and then try to solve the problem by myself.
